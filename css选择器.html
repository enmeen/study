    <p>The radial-gradient property takes a few arguments. The first is the center position for the start of the gradient. This follows the form *shape* at *position*. In this case case, it’s a circle with it’s center position 100 pixels in from the left and 100 pixels from the top. Next a series of colours is specified. You can specify more than two colours, but it is then necessary to include a distance with each one so that the gradient knows when to blend each colour into the next. In this example just two colours are specified. This lets the browser assumes the first is 0% and the latter is 100%, and it draws the gradient between these to colours. If we wanted other steps in the gradient, we could specify distances in pixels or percentages, as you’ll see later. So we have something that looks a bit 3D-ish. It’s ok, but let’s try to make it look a bit nicer.</p>
